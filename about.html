          <h3>Jacob Henson</h3>
          <p>Howdy! I am Jacob Henson, the proud creator of APTT LLC. I founded this company because I want to protect those who are taken advantage of online. My passion for APTT is fueled by a family friend who was phished and scammed while on her deathbed. She was one of the sweetest people I have ever met and did not deserve to be taken advantage of, leaving her family with crippling debt all because of a scammer. I find joy in stopping scammers from profiting from good trustworthy people, and I also enjoy teaching and spreading passion myself. This is why APTT was the perfect solution for everything I wanted to teach.
          <br><br>
          When I am not working on APTT, I spend my time working at a Hospital’s IT Security Center. I manage all security related tasks while keeping vulnerable people safe by protecting the providers that care for them from outside attackers. When I do have free time, which is rare, I enjoy reading all kinds of books, listening to narrative focused podcasts, and worldbuilding through creative writing and art.
