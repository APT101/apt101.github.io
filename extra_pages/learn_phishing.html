          <h3>Module 2: What is Phishing?</h3>
          <p>
            Phishing is structured impersonation delivered through digital messages. Attackers replicate the style, branding, and tone of trusted organizations. Logos, fonts, signatures, and domain look-alikes are assembled to create messages that appear legitimate at a glance. The message content is designed to induce rapid action: password resets, security warnings, document-sharing alerts, payment notifications, shipping updates, or account verifications. Every element is optimized to suppress skepticism and accelerate compliance.
            <br><br>
            The attacker’s payload appears as either a link or an attachment. Malicious links redirect the user to a fraudulent site crafted to imitate the real one. Login pages are cloned precisely. When the target enters their credentials, the attacker captures them instantly. Some phishing sites forward the credentials to the real service to hide the compromise. Malicious attachments operate differently. They arrive as invoices, spreadsheets, reports, or shared files. Opening them triggers malware that establishes unauthorized access, exfiltrates data, or deploys ransomware.
            <br><br>
            Phishing relies on predictability. People expect routine digital communication from banks, cloud services, government agencies, and internal departments. Attackers exploit these expectations. Minor inconsistencies in sender domains, link destinations, grammar, or formatting are often overlooked when the message appears urgent. The attacker uses timing strategically, sending messages during busy periods when scrutiny is reduced.
            <br><br>
            Defense is procedural and technical. Users must inspect domains directly, not through embedded links. Access to any service must occur through manually typed addresses or verified bookmarks. Unexpected attachments are rejected. Sender identity is validated before any action is taken. Multifactor authentication mitigates some attacks but does not eliminate credential theft, especially when real-time relay attacks are used. Hard refusal to engage with unsolicited prompts removes the attacker’s advantage.
