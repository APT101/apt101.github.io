          <h3>Module 2: What is Phishing?</h3>
          <p>
            Phishing is a kind of online trick where an attacker pretends to be someone that you trust. They copy the look and feel of real companies by using the same logos, fonts, signatures, and even similar web addresses so that their message looks real at first glance.The message (typically an email) tries to make you act fast. It might say you need to reset a password, check a security warning, share a document, pay a bill, get a shipping update, or verify an account. Every detail is chosen specifically to stop you from doubting it and to get you to act quickly.
            <br><br>
            When the attacker uses a link, the link oftentimes takes you to a fake website that looks just like the real one. If you type your username and password there, the attacker steals them right away. Some fake sites even forward the credentials to the real service so the theft stays hidden and you are none the wiser. When the attacker uses an attachment in their attack, the file may look like an invoice, spreadsheet, report, or shared document. Opening it can install malware that lets the attacker sneak into your computer, steal data, or lock everything you have forever with ransomware.
            <br><br>
            Phishing works because people expect regular emails from banks, commonly used services, government agencies, and their own company’s departments. This means that attackers count on these expectations. Small mistakes like a slightly off domain, a weird link, odd grammar, or strange formatting are often missed when the message looks urgent. Attackers also send these messages during busy times when people are less careful, like during your workday.
            <br><br>
            To stay safe, always look at the web address yourself instead of clicking a link. Type the address into your browser or use a trusted bookmark to access the site in question. Don’t open unexpected attachments, and check who really sent the message before you do anything. Using multifactor authentication helps deter these attacks, but it isn’t a complete fix, especially against real time relay attacks. Simply ignoring or deleting any unsolicited messages removes the attacker’s chance to harm you.
