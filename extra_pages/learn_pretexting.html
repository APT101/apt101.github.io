          <h3>Module 1: What is Pretexting?</h3>
          <p>
          Pretexting is a lie told and created by an attacker. How it works is simple and noticing it is important. First the attacker picks a pretend role at a company like someone from HR, a finance auditor, a vendor, a legal officer, or an executive assistant. They choose a role that people usually trust because it fits the company’s everyday workflow.
          <br><br>
          Next, the attacker makes up a story that sounds routine and pretty normal, such as fixing a payroll mistake, renewing a contract, updating a policy, checking an invoice, doing system maintenance, or reviewing access rights. These are the “anchors” that make their story feel real and believable therefore gaining your trust.
          <br><br>
          So, when the attacker contacts the target by email, phone, in person, or a chat app and they start by sounding friendly and confident it may be pretexting. They use facts they can find online, like names, department titles, or upcoming events, to make the story believable. The trick is to give enough detail to sound legit, but not so much that you have time to think too hard about it.
          <br><br>
          Now, after they get you to believe the story, the attacker slowly asks for more and more information. At first it might be something harmless, like a simple document, then it could become employee records, internal files, passwords, or access to systems. Each request is presented as a tiny, routine need, so it doesn’t raise alarm.
          <br><br>
          The attack works when you treat the fake scenario as real. The way to stop it is to always verify who you’re talking to. Use a separate, trusted channel (like a known phone number or a face to face conversation) to confirm the person’s identity before sharing any credentials, documents, or access. If you never give out anything without that independent check, pretexting becomes much harder for the attacker.
