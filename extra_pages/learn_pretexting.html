          <h3>Module 1: What is Pretexting?</h3>
          <p>
          Pretexting is methodical fabrication. The attacker begins by selecting an identity that fits into established workflows: HR staff, finance auditor, external consultant, vendor support, legal compliance officer, or executive assistant. The chosen persona is not random; it is calculated to exploit routine trust relationships. The attacker then constructs a scenario that blends seamlessly into the organization’s normal operations. Payroll corrections, contract renewals, policy updates, invoice reconciliations, system maintenance, access reviews, and regulatory checks are common anchors. The attacker uses these anchors to frame every request as routine business.
          <br><br>
          Once the persona and scenario are stable, the attacker initiates contact. This may occur by email, phone call, in-person conversation, or message through a collaboration platform. The contact opens with familiarity and confidence. The attacker often uses publicly available details—names, departments, organizational structures, upcoming events—to reinforce the illusion. The key mechanism is cognitive loading: the attacker presents a story dense enough to feel legitimate but simple enough that the target will not analyze it deeply.
          <br><br>
          After establishing acceptance, the attacker escalates. Requests begin with harmless details, then move toward controlled information: employee records, internal documents, credentials, system access, financial data, or procedural insights. The escalation is slow to avoid triggering suspicion. Each request is framed as a small administrative necessity. The deception is sustained through tone, context, and timing.
          <br><br>
          The attack succeeds when the target treats the invented scenario as operational truth. The defense is strict procedural verification. Identities must be confirmed through independent channels. Requests must be validated by contacting known individuals directly, not through the channel the attacker controls. Separation between communication and authentication is mandatory. No credential, no document, no system access is granted without verification. Pretexting becomes ineffective when verification interrupts the narrative.
